"So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we've caught 'em. We've caught 'em all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught 'em all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office. He knew about it too. So don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You're soliciting. You're asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There's fraud. They found 'em in creeks. They found some, with the name Trump, just happened to have the name Trump, just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They're being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's nice. On November 3rd, you're watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we're going to do well because people are really happy with the job we've done. But you know what? We won't know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They're losing 30 and 40%. It's a fraud, and it's a shame. And can you imagine where they say, uh, ""You have to have your ballot in by November 10th."" November 10th. That means, that's seven days after the election, in theory, should've been announced.","['O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," And then they'll start counting the ballots.

"Thank you, Admiral. I thought since you're running for vice president, that we ought to start off by talking about the vice presidency itself. The vice president presides over the Senate, he casts a deciding vote in case of a tie, but his role really depends on the assignments that are given to him by the president. However, if a president should die in office, or is unable to serve for any other reason, the vice president automatically becomes president, and that has happened 5 times in this century. So the proposition I put on the table for you to discuss is this. What role would each of you like to play as vice president, what areas interest you, and what are your qualifications to serve as president, if necessary?

"To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country. Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land. We cannot cast aside these regulations. We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.

"I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality. And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years. If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world. If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa. So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy. And I believe that we used our skill. Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations. He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia. Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh - Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government. This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken. And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world. There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world. But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement. And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible. And we will do it with the highest moral principles.","['B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim',

"Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement. He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament. He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin. The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing. In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States. The Soviet Union does understand strength. We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago. If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.

"I don't think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We've been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

They also didn't have a plan to win the peace. They also didn't put the alliances together to make this successful. We need a fresh start.

"No, I do not. And, Gwen, at the time, I was talking specifically about this question of unilateral sanctions. What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there's a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don't have any impact, except to penalize American companies. We've got sanctions on Iran now. We may well want to go to the U. N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don't live up to their obligations under the initial -- International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty. We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U. N. Security Council. We're working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who've been negotiating with the Iranians. We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency. And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran's living up to their commitments and obligations. And if they aren't, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U. N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go. We're addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around. One of the great by-products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done. This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that. The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A. Q.

"Thank you, Jim. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching. One thing I would like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said. It's a remarkable thing in a country like ours, a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for president. Could have a chance to serve as president. First thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be president. This election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st Century. Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, you're on your own? Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it or saying you can get across yourself? If you don't agree -- leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don't leave with anything else, I hope you will leave with this. This is a real important election. The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other, huge changes. And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences. So we've talked about our responsibility tonight. I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility. Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th. Because you're going to decide whether we're going to balance the budget now, but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. You will decide whether we're going to keep fighting crime with a Brady Bill, assault weapons and finish putting those 100,000 police. Whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work. Whether we're going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns. Whether we're going to give our children a world-class education. Where every eight-year-old can read. Every 12-year-old can log in on the Internet. Every 18-year-old can go to college. If we do those things we will build that bridge to the 21st Century and the greatest country in history will be even greater.

"I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge. I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid. The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell! me that the Federal grants that come with. for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority. If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money. What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs? Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities. I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about. But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them? New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit. But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia. Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place? But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed. I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives. The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working. And why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones? Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there. The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work. We could have an urban homestead act.

<claim> One of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.</claim>
<claim> The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell! me that the Federal grants that come with. for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.</claim>
<claim> If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money.</claim>
<claim> What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?</claim>
<claim> Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities.</claim>
<claim> I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.</claim>
<claim> But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?</claim>
<claim> New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit.</claim>
<claim> But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.</claim>
<claim> wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?</claim>
<claim> But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed.</claim>
<claim> I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives.</claim>
<claim> The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.</claim>

"Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate. I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I'm happy to be here with Tipper and our family. I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience. I have questioned his proposals. And here is why. I think this is a very important moment for our country. We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. And in this election, America has to make an important choice. Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families? I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices. If I'm entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the national debt. I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them. And I will cut taxes for middle-class families. I believe it's important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus. If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people. If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won't be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe. By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution. I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families. And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security.

"I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea. So, on the foundation. I am glad to talk about the foundation. The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world. It provides AIDS drugs to about 11. 5 million people. It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses. It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does. The Clinton Foundation does an awful lot of good work. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation. The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States. So the foundation does good work. And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States. But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation. The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns. He's refused to do it. His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia. And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit. It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non-profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Well, Gwen, it's hard to know where to start; there are so many inaccuracies there. The fact of the matter is the troops wouldn't have what they have today if you guys had had your way. You talk about internationalizing the effort. They don't have a plan. Basically, it's an echo. You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in '91 was far stronger than this. No. We had 34 countries then; we've got 30 today. We've got troops beside us. It's hard, after John Kerry referred to our allies as a coalition of the coerced and the bribed, to go out and persuade people to send troops and to participate in this process. You end up with a situation in which -- talk about demeaning. In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it's the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops. Makes no sense at all. It's totally inconsistent. There isn't a plan there. Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi. He came recently and addressed a joint session of Congress that I presided over with the speaker of the House.

<claim>You talk about internationalizing the effort. They don't have a plan.</claim>
<premise>Basically, it's an echo.</premise>
<claim>You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in '91 was far stronger than this.</claim>
<premise>No. We had 34 countries then; we've got 30 today.</premise>
<premise>We've got troops beside us.</premise>

"I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off. And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly. And the reason I've had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record. And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence. And in the process the negatives began. It wasn't me that was there at that convention. Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention. And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down. I didn't do that. But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat. He's the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU. And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda. Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left. I support that. But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.

"No. As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need. And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D - 5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman -- we have a whole range of technology. Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck. It'll draw an attack. It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon. And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1. The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built. Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control. That's why I'm for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber -- which I've supported for years -- that can penetrate the Soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it is because their radar system is frustrated. In other words, a President has to make choices. This makes us stronger. The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need. Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength. We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons. It's in this way, by making wise choices, that we're stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control.

"Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright. Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated. First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik. Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public. Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be. Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. Well let me make one thing clear. Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism. Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong. And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations. Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China. Let's look at the vote on Hungary. There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year. Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session. Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? Not at all. The President gained. America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.","['O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise',

<claim>Mr. Cronkite, America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be.</claim>
<claim>When we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight;</claim>
<claim>that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not;</claim>
<claim>that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science;</claim>
<claim>when he states that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools;</claim>
<claim>when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night;</claim>
<claim>when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.</claim>
<claim>Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.</claim>
<claim>Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong.</claim>
<claim>And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.</claim>
<claim>Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.</claim>
<claim>Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China. Let's look at the vote on Hungary. There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.</claim>
<claim>Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session. Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? Not at all. The President gained. America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps"

"Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960. It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America. Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits. I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America. We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains. I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them. And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs. We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from.

<claim> Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.</claim>
<claim> Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.</claim>
<claim> We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains.</claim>
<claim> We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from. It's going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco.</claim>
<claim> In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.</claim>
<premise> It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.</premise>
<premise> Until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.</premise>"

(APPLAUSE) And retired Vice Admiral James Stockdale, who is the vice presidential nominee -- (APPLAUSE) -- for independent candidate Ross Perot. (APPLAUSE) Now, the ground rules for tonight's debate. Each candidate will have 2 minutes for an opening statement. I will then present the issues to be discussed. For each topic, the candidates will have a minute and 15 seconds to respond. Then this will be followed by a 5 minute discussion period in which they can ask questions of each other if they so choose. Now, the order of response has been determined by a drawing and we'll rotate with each topic. At the end of the debate, each candidate will have 2 minutes for a closing statement. Our radio and TV audience should know that the candidates were given an equal allocation of auditorium seats for their supporters. So I'd like to ask the audience here in the theater to please refrain from applause or any partisan demonstration once the debate is under way because it takes time away from the candidates.

"I do disagree. Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses. Here is my plan. I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt. And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security. That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years. Now, I think that it's very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time. Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth. And you talk about cutting benefits. I don't go along with it. I am opposed to it. I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund. Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year. The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation. His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing. It would borrow up to $3 trillion. Now, Social Security has never done that. And I don't think it should do that. I think it should stay in a lockbox, and I'll tell you this. I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"May I respond briefly? What the vice president has just said is just a complete distortion. The American people saw John Kerry on Thursday night. They don't need the vice president or the president to tell them what they saw.

"Let me start with the numbers. With all due respect, the Senate Budget Committee estimates that Dick Cheney has just referred to are the estimates of the partisan Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee. We're using the numbers presented by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. We start with an agreement which is this surplus in the Social Security fund should be locked up and used for Social Security. That's where the agreement ends. We also agree and believe and pledge that the surplus in the Medicare trust fund should also be locked up with a sign on it that says politicians keep your hands off. Our opponents do not do that. In fact, they raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for, well, their tax cut and other programs that they can't afford because they've spent so much on the tax cut. Let me come back to the remaining $1. 8 trillion that we both talked about. The numbers show that $1. 6 trillion goes to the big tax cut which, as Al Gore said the other night, sends 43% to the top 1%. Worse than that, when you add on the other spending programs that our opponents have committed to, plus the cost of their plan to privatize Social Security, by our calculations they're $1. 1 trillion in debt. That means we go back down the road to higher interest rates, to higher unemployment, to a kind of self-tax increase on every American family. Because when interest rates go up, so, too, do the cost of mortgage payments, car payments, student loans, credit card transactions. So if we've learned anything over the last eight years, it is that one of the most important things the government can do, the federal government, probably the most important, is to be fiscally responsible. And that's why Al Gore and I are committed to balancing the budget every year. In fact, the paying off the debt by the year 2012, when by our calculation our opponent's economic plan still leaves America $2. 8 trillion in debt.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare. The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO. It's not, and let me explain the difference. Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I'm making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor. Your doctor chooses your prescription. No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you. Then you go to your own pharmacy. You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost. If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.

"I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich. The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now. The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that. The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska. Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country. And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety. But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.

You did the 1990-and that's why, if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super-predators, and you've called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned, and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200-250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every... Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, ""I support President Trump."" I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won't do it, because they're run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don't. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don't want to say anything about law and order. And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party. I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation. For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment. Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights. Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.

And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.

"I'm saying specifically that I don't believe he has the qualities we need in a commander in chief because I don't think, based on his record, that he would pursue the kind of aggressive policies that need to be pursued if we're going to defeat these terrorists. We need to battle them overseas so we don't have to battle them here at home. I'm not challenging John Kerry's patriotism. I said in my acceptance speech in New York City at the Republican convention that we respected his service in Vietnam, and I got applause for that. We've never criticized his patriotism. What we've questioned is his judgment. And his judgment's flawed, and the record's there for anybody who wants to look at it. In 1984, when he ran for the Senate he opposed, or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the Cold War and are important today to our overall forces. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and occupied it in 1990 and '91, he stood up on the floor of the Senate and voted against going in to liberate Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back to Iraq. The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn't display the qualities of somebody who has conviction. And with respect to this particular operation, we've seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war, John Edwards and John Kerry, then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed -- body armor, spare parts, ammunition -- they voted against it. I couldn't figure out why that happened initially. And then I looked and figured out that what was happening was Howard Dean was making major progress in the Democratic primaries, running away with the primaries based on an anti-war record. So they, in effect, decided they would cast an anti-war vote and they voted against the troops. Now if they couldn't stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaida?","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']"," That's the question we have to ask ourselves.

"Well, Milosevic has lost the election. His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election. It's overwhelming. Milosevic's government refuses to release the vote count. There's now a general strike going on. They're demonstrating. I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election. The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office. Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote. Now, we've made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world. That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing. Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions. Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism -- even if they don't like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there. So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it. But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done. And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program. I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level. It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them. Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12. 5% under President Ford. He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something. But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat. I said many foolish things back in those days. But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.

"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough. I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people. and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did. I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf. But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile. We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities. We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling. We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient. I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country. Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve. According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today. So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," But I don't think that we should be afraid of that.

Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives. I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done. It is going to require a new spirit. A spirit of cooperation. It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, let's come together to do what is right for America.

And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans. I want to finally get something done on Social Security. I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money. I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace. I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs. I don't want to try to put our troops in all places at all times. I don't want to be the world's policeman, I want to be the world's peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped. I want anti-ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends. I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise. I've had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind.

"Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one. I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again. If we fail then, if we're unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers. Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there's some indications that by the time the next president's term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war. So one more effort should be made. I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere. They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space. But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States. If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race. I hope we can succeed. But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground. I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it. There may be testing in outer space. I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere. It's possible to detect those kind of tests. The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space. So that I'm hopeful we can try once more. If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves. But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons. China may have it by 1963, Egypt. War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.

"Miss Quinn, I don't have to. I've done it. We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7. 5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, John's been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5. 7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan. But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget. We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.","['O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"I uh - said that I've served this country for fourteen years. I served it uh - in the war. I'm devoted to it. If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country. But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world. Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. We're not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didn't make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didn't we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again. I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.","['B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise',

"Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you. I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly. I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience. These problems are not easy. They're not going to be solved overnight. But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things. First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things -- more jobs and better schools. Our schools are now better. Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country. We talked about that. This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty. I'm proud of that. It happened because I could work with people -- Republicans and Democrats. That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign. You have to decide whether you want to change or not. We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work. We've had 12 years of trickle down economics. It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy. I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly. But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget. We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you. I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents. We're better than that. We can do better than that.

There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out. But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue. I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.

"The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase. It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then. Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most. What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.

"Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann. But there are many people who I admire in this country today. Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress. Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me. I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive. We were proud of them. We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us. I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had. And he's a hero. I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people. Because they inspire them. They teach them. But more than that, they are role models. Members of the clergy who have done the same. Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support. I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids. So there are many, many heroes in this country today. These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month. In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models. And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come.","['O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Let me uh - speak out very strongly. The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas. I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want. In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development. In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars. We have a good housing program, uh - that uh - will result in cutting uh - the down payments by 50 percent and uh - having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period. We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.

"I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.

"Actually what I've said, Jim. I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors. And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors. And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors. It seems like they can't get it done. Now, they may blame other folks, but it's time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors. And so what I've said is that there's been some missed opportunities. They've had a chance. They've had a chance to form consensus. I've got a plan on Medicare, for example, that's a two-stage plan that says we'll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program. But I also want to say to seniors, if you're happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program. But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan. They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors. And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, it's time to get it done once and for all. That's what I've been critical about the administration for. Same with Social Security. I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without. Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there's a Social Security system around tomorrow. There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," So that's what I've been saying about Social Security.

"Good evening from Case Western Reserve University's Veale Center here in Cleveland, Ohio. I'm Gwen Ifill of ""The NewsHour"" and ""Washington Week"" on PBS, and I welcome you to the first and the only vice presidential debate between Vice President Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Edwards, the Democratic nominee. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight's will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce the rules they have devised for themselves to the best of my ability. The questions tonight will be divided between foreign and domestic policy, but the specific topics were chosen by me. The candidates have not been told what they are. The rules: For each question, there can be only a two- minute response, a 90-second rebuttal and, at my discretion, a discussion extension of one minute. A green light will come on when 30 seconds remain in any given answer, yellow at 15 seconds, red at five seconds, and then flashing red means time's up. There's also a back-up buzzer system, if needed. Candidates may not direct questions to one another. There will be two-minute closing statements, but no opening statements. There is an audience here in the hall, but they have been instructed to remain silent throughout. The order of the first question was determined by the candidates in advance, and the first one goes to Vice President Cheney. Vice President Cheney, there have been new developments in Iraq, especially having to do with the administration's handling. Paul Bremer, the former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, gave a speech in which he said that we have never had enough troops on the ground, or we've never had enough troops on the ground. Donald Rumsfeld said he has not seen any hard evidence of a link between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein. Was this approved -- of a report that you requested that you received a week ago that showed there was no connection between Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein?","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party. The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation. These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them. I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address. I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans.

"Oh, I'm it's my question.

Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival. For a belief that law must be based on a higher law. For a return to traditions and values that we once had. Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator. That we're a nation under God. Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child. I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California. Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that.

"Thank you, Mr. Hilliard. When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation. We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials. This has been a very successful effort. That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed. Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1. 3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish. We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit. Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs. We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past. It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens. I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded. I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country. Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem. We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesn't want you to know what he's doing is loading up IOUs for future generations. He puts no real assets into the Social Security system. The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made. For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear. A promise made will be a promise kept. You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money. That's the difference of opinion. The vice president thinks it's the government's money. The payroll taxes are your money. You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion. The money stays within the Social Security system. It's a part of the Social Security system. He claims it will be out of Social Security. It's your money, it's a part of your retirement benefit. It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.

"Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran. And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen. The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down. Have things gotten better? The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners -- things of that kind. But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions. The matter of Somoza -- no, I never defended Somoza. And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place. And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press. And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution. Many of them are now the contras. They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some. And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government. And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative? It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines. They have been our friend since their inception as a nation. And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative. And I think that we're better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific.","['O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"Well, the vice president talks about there being a member, or someone associated with Al Qaida, in Iraq. There are 60 countries who have members of Al Qaida in them. How many of those countries are we going to invade? Not only that, he talks about Iran. The reality about Iran is that Iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch. They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans. Now, the vice president, as you pointed out, spoke out loudly for lifting the sanctions on Iraq. John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq, including closing the loophole that allows companies to use a subsidiary, offshore subsidiaries to do business with Iran. I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion, and you raised it in this question. This is relevant, because he was pushing for lifting sanctions when he was CEO of Halliburton. Here's why we didn't think Halliburton should have a no-bid contract. While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay. They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States. They're now under investigation for having bribed foreign officials during that period of time. Not only that, they've gotten a $7. 5 billion no-bid contract in Iraq, and instead of part of their money being withheld, which is the way it's normally done, because they're under investigation, they've continued to get their money.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," So, we don't think that's right.

"If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude. I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about. It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high. But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area. And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers. And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief. Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend. I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.

<claim> I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: </claim>
<claim> I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about. </claim>
<claim> It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high. </claim>
<premise> But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area. </premise>
<premise> And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers. </premise>
<claim> And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief. </claim>
<claim> Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend. </claim>
<premise> I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens. We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved. </premise>
<claim> So I think we ought to take care of the taxpayers first. </claim>"

"Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties. I think you've seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing - we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft. We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue. I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me. I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble. I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems. If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy? Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable? Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be? Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote? I don't think you do think that. And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980. You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing. It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes. We've got to stop drifting. What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important. A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November. And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding. If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant. The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be? The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis. Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.

"I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones. Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area. And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas. The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city because the city isn't getting any tax from that now. And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either. I think there are things to do in this regard. I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977. You have to see it to believe it. It looks like a bombed-out city - great, gaunt skeletons of buildings. Windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises;"" on another, ""Despair."" And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department. There are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat.

"Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program. I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level. It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them. Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12. 5% under President Ford. He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something. But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat. I said many foolish things back in those days. But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept. And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today. That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept. It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"I think public education is a solution. Our desire is to find ways to reform our educational system, to return it to its former glory. I'm a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools. We believe very much in the public school system.

We've had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results. That's unacceptable from our standpoint.

"Well, as I've said, I am not an enemy of conservation. I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were. But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left. That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years. As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that.

"Gwen, I want to thank you, and I want to thank the folks here at Case Western Reserve for hosting this tonight. It's a very important event, and they've done a superb job of putting it together. It's important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror. And, after 9/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror. And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons. Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida. Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director's testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship. The effort that we've mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action. The world is far safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail, his government is no longer in power. And we did exactly the right thing.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

First, my faith plays a lot -- a big part in my life. And that's, when I was answering that question, what I was really saying to the person was that I pray a lot. And I do. And my faith is a very -- it's very personal. I pray for strength. I pray for wisdom. I pray for our troops in harm's way. I pray for my family. I pray for my little girls. But I'm mindful in a free society that people can worship if they want to or not. You're equally an American if you choose to worship an almighty and if you choose not to. If you're a Christian, Jew or Muslim, you're equally an American. That's the great thing about America, is the right to worship the way you see fit. Prayer and religion sustain me. I receive calmness in the storms of the presidency. I love the fact that people pray for me and my family all around the country. Somebody asked me one time, ""Well, how do you know? ""I said, ""I just feel it. "" Religion is an important part. I never want to impose my religion on anybody else. But when I make decisions, I stand on principle, and the principles are derived from who I am. I believe we ought to love our neighbor like we love ourself, as manifested in public policy through the faith-based initiative where we've unleashed the armies of compassion to help heal people who hurt. I believe that God wants everybody to be free. That's what I believe. And that's been part of my foreign policy. In Afghanistan, I believe that the freedom there is a gift from the Almighty. And I can't tell you how encouraged I am to see freedom on the march. And so my principles that I make decisions on are a part of me, and religion is a part of me.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," So I think it's fair to say that my faith has influenced my policies.

"Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that. As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that. (Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses. I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests. I think I'm a reasonably likable guy. (Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature. But I'm also a serious guy. I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way. So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November. (Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices. Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he's not going to raise taxes. I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it. And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice. So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it. The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink. And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people. But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people. And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver. When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver. Well, we've seen what has happened. We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term. Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%. And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be. Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information. He went so far as to call it ""brutal economics."" I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first. I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done. But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference. Somebody worked it out. And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more. So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes. And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income. I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about. But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.","['I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise',

<claim>Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost.</claim>
<premise>because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.</premise>
<claim>When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver.</claim>
<premise>Well, we've seen what has happened.</premise>
<premise>We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised;</premise>
<premise>we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.</premise>
<premise>Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.</premise>
<premise>And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.</premise>
<claim>Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.</claim>
<premise>His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.</premise>
<premise>He went so far as to call it ""brutal economics.""</premise>
<claim>I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.</claim>
<premise>I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.</premise>
<premise>But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference.</prem"

"Well, if it's in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened. That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force. Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear. Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be. Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win. Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped. And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy. I would take the use of force very seriously. I would be guarded in my approach. I don't think we can be all things to all people in the world. I think we've got to be very careful when we commit our troops. The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops. He believes in nation building. I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders. I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. So I would take my responsibility seriously. And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power. Morale in today's military is too low. We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals. We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals. Some of our troops are not well-equipped. I believe we're overextended in too many places. And therefore I want to rebuild the military power. It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform.

"One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe. I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution. We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily. But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union. I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties. We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate. We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House. I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union. Secondly, the relations between Russia and China. They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest. No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully. If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world. Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world. India started from about the same place that China did. Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years. India under a free society has been making some progress. But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system. Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free. This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe. It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe. They want to be free. And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists. They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists. And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom. We can make it move. We can put the Communists on the defensive.","['B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim',

"Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it. You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.

"Yes. I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt. I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes. As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security. That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security. He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development. Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year. And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget. If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about. As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries.

"Well, first of all, I do agree that we've been largely absent, not entirely absent, but largely absent from the peace-making process over the last four years. And let me just say a couple of preliminary things and then talk about where we are now. First, the Israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves, they should defend themselves. They have an obligation to defend themselves. I mean, if I can, just for a moment, tell you a personal story. I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, actually three years ago, in August of 2001, staying at the King David Hotel. We left in the morning, headed to the airport to leave, and later in the day I found out that that same day, not far from where we were staying, the Sbarro Pizzeria was hit by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem. Fifteen people were killed. Six children were killed. What are the Israeli people supposed to do? How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists? They have not only the right but the obligation to defend themselves. Now, we know that the prime minister has made a decision, a historic decision, to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza. It's important for America to participate in helping with that process. Now, if Gaza's being used as a platform for attacking the Israeli people, that has to be stopped. And Israel has a right to defend itself. They don't have a partner for peace right now. They certainly don't have a partner in Arafat, and they need a legitimate partner for peace. And I might add, it is very important for America to crack down on the Saudis who have not had a public prosecution for financing terrorism since 9/11.

<claim>Well, first of all, I do agree that we've been largely absent, not entirely absent, but largely absent from the peace-making process over the last four years.</claim>
<premise>And let me just say a couple of preliminary things and then talk about where we are now.</premise>
<claim>The Israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves, they should defend themselves. They have an obligation to defend themselves.</claim>
<premise>I mean, if I can, just for a moment, tell you a personal story.</premise>
<claim>I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, actually three years ago, in August of 2001, staying at the King David Hotel. We left in the morning, headed to the airport to leave, and later in the day I found out that that same day, not far from where we were staying, the Sbarro Pizzeria was hit by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem. Fifteen people were killed. Six children were killed.</claim>
<premise>What are the Israeli people supposed to do? How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists?</premise>
<claim>They have not only the right but the obligation to defend themselves.</claim>
<premise>Now, we know that the prime minister has made a decision, a historic decision, to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza.</premise>
<claim>It's important for America to participate in helping with that process.</claim>
<premise>Now, if Gaza's being used as a platform for attacking the Israeli people, that has to be stopped.</premise>
<claim>And Israel has a right to defend itself.</claim>
<premise>They don't have a partner for peace right now.</premise>
<claim>They certainly don't have a partner in Arafat, and they need a legitimate partner for peace.</claim>
<premise>And I might add, it is very important for America to crack down on the Saudis who have not had a public prosecution for financing terrorism since 9/11.</premise>

"I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history. We're at a fork in the road. We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind. And we have a very important decision to make. Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few? One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for? Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families. Why? Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet. You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids. And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you. Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D. C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you. I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way. There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa. I mentioned her earlier. She's 79 years old. She has Social Security. I'm not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would.

"Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President. First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955. I have sustained it since then. I've said that I agree with the Administration policy. Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores. I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy. I've supported that policy. In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly. So that really isn't an issue in this campaign. It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy. Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign. The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security? Is our relative strength growing? Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low? I don't believe it is. I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing. And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States. I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States. In 1957 I was in Havana. I talked to the American Ambassador there. He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba. And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done. Our d- security depends upon Latin America. Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what's happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call - not on Washington during the campaign - but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil? At the American Conference - Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn't even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro. It was rather a vague statement that they finally made. Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again? Africa is now the emerging area of the world. It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly. We didn't even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957. In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand. If there's one thing Africa needs it's technical assistance. And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world. We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down. We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate. There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine. We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world. Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years? That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago. But are we doing enough in these areas? What are freedom's chances in those areas? By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America? Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others? Will the Congo go Communist? Will other countries? Are we doing enough in that area? And what about Asia? Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it? Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years? Communism? The Chinese? Or will freedom? The question which we have to decide as Americans - are we doing enough today? Is our strength and prestige rising? Do people want to be identified with us? Do they want to follow United States leadership? I don't think they do, enough. And that's what concerns me. In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations. On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa. The rest either abstained or voted against us. More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us. I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade. I have seen Cuba go to the Communists. I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America. I have seen us ignore Africa. There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations. There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six. When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day. We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months. I believe that the world is changing fast. And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better. The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year. The Communists say, ""Come with us; look what we've done."" And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested. I think we're going to have to do better. Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world. I think we are today. But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them. They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles. I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963. He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom. I agree with him. What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world. And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain. We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world. I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon. The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them. And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A. The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged. We want peace. We want freedom. We want security. We want to be stronger. We want freedom to gain. But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change. I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move. I think we have to revita1ize our society. I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first. And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O',

"First of all, I do have mandatory testing. I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don't have to take all applicants. Now, private schools play a great role in our society. All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. But I don't think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom. Let me give you another example. I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning. Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country. There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever. We're in an information age when learning is more important than ever. 90% of our kids go to public schools. We have to make it the number one priority. Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality -- high-quality, safe school. If it's a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina. Here is another difference. The governor, if it's a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school. It's an illusion.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Barbara, you've asked that question twice. I think you ought to have at least one answer to it. I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages. Now, this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there? And I said, well, yes. And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that? These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me. I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas? First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing. Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that they're coming home soon, or that might cause them harm. What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made? And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.

"I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich. The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now. The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that. The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska. Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country. And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.

"Well, I must say it's one of the disappointments of the last four years, is that we've not been able to do what the president did in Texas, for example, when he was able to reach across the aisle and bring Democrats along on major issues of the day. We had some success early on, I think, in No Child Left Behind, when we, in fact, had broad, bipartisan support. We had a lot of support for the Patriot Act, when we passed that on a bipartisan basis. Now we're seeing objection to that by the other side. All I know is to continue to try to work it. It's a disappointment, in a sense, that I remember from my earlier service when things worked much differently, when, in fact, some of my best friends in the Congress were people I worked with, like Tom Foley, who was a majority leader and later speaker of the House. One of my strongest allies in Congress when I was secretary of defense was Jack Murtha, a Democrat who is chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We used to be able to do more together on a bipartisan basis than seems possible these days. I'm not sure exactly why.

"Good evening from the Field House at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm Charles Gibson of ABC News and ""Good Morning America."" I welcome you to the second of the 2004 presidential debates between President George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee. The debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight's format is going to be a bit different. We have assembled a town-hall meeting. We're in the Show-Me State, as everyone knows Missouri to be, so Missouri residents will ask the questions. These 140 citizens were identified by the Gallup Organization as not yet committed in this election. Now, earlier today, each audience member gave me two questions on cards like this, one they'd like to ask the president, the other they'd like to ask the senator. I have selected the questions to be asked and the order. No one has seen the final list of questions but me, certainly not the candidates. No audience member knows if he or she will be called upon. Audience microphones will be turned off after a question is asked. Audience members will address their question to a specific candidate. He'll have two minutes to answer. The other candidate will have a minute and a half for rebuttal. And I have the option of extending discussion for one minute, to be divided equally between the two men. All subjects are open for discussion. And you probably know the light system by now. Green light at 30 seconds, yellow at 15, red at five, and flashing red means you're done. Those are the candidates' rules. I will hold the candidates to the time limits forcefully but politely, I hope.

"Yes. The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place. But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end. They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future. Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage.

"I see. Well, I think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president. Different presidents approach it in different ways. When George Bush asked me to sign on, it obviously wasn't because he was worried about carrying Wyoming. We got 70 percent of the vote in Wyoming, although those three electoral votes turned out to be pretty important last time around. What he said he wanted me to do was to sign on because of my experience to be a member of the team, to help him govern, and that's exactly the way he's used me. And I think from the perspective of the nation, it's worked in our relationship, in this administration. I think it's worked in part because I made it clear that I don't have any further political aspirations myself. And I think that's been an advantage. I think it allows the president to know that my only agenda is his agenda. I'm not worried about what some precinct committeemen in Iowa were thinking of me with respect to the next round of caucuses of 2008.

"No, but I'm glad you asked that question, because I know it's on many peoples' minds. I have ordered an investigation. I know that the CIA is already going forward with one. We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras. And he drew up this manual. It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed. And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed. But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA. Now, those are the details as we have them. And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that. We'll take the proper action at the proper time. I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group. So, I can only tell you about the manual -- that we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt. But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans. Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom - extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there're several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace - it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we're the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we're in a race for survival - a race in which it isn't enough to be ahead; it isn't enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise',

<claim>Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans.</claim>
<claim>Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.</claim>
<claim>I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.</claim>
<claim>There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.</claim>
<claim>And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?</claim>
<claim>Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world?</claim>
<claim>There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.</claim>
<claim>And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.</claim>
<claim>I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world.</claim>
<claim>I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.</claim>
<claim>First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past.</claim>
<claim>In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.</claim>
<claim>And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.</claim>
<claim>In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed.</claim>
<claim>We ended the Korean War;</claim>
<claim>by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars;</claim>
<claim>and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.</claim>
<claim>Now why were we successful, as"

He was, in fact, in Baghdad before the war, and he's in Baghdad now after the war. The fact of the matter is that this is exactly the kind of track record we've seen over the years.

"Gwen, we've never let up on Osama bin Laden from day one. We've actively and aggressively pursued him. We've captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan. We'll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I'm confident eventually we'll get him. The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which we've done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization. John Edwards, two and a half years ago, six months after we went into Afghanistan announced that it was chaotic, the situation was deteriorating, the warlords were about to take over. Here we are, two and a half years later, we're four days away from a democratic election, the first one in history in Afghanistan. We've got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women. That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December. We've made enormous progress in Afghanistan, in exactly the right direction, in spite of what John Edwards said two and a half years ago. He just got it wrong. The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary. We're standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security. We'll keep U. S. forces there -- we have about 16,000 there today -- as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation. But they're making significant progress. We have President Karzai, who is in power. They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever. Schools are open. Young girls are going to school. Women are going to vote.

"Yes. I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy. And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time. The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons. And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet. But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done. The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever. Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have. It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority. Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States. Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal. And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," So, if you want to know why I am opposed to the SALT II treaty, it is because it is not in the national security interest of the United States, it is illegal, and it is not equal.

"Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed. This is a decision that the president of the United States must make. The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948. This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States. There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state. I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state. I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful. The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power. The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs. Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state. I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs. I'm asking the people's support as president. We will select the best man we can get.

"Yes. Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.

If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition. This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race. It would be very disturbing to American people. It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican. And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty.

"Well, the vice president talks about there being a member, or someone associated with Al Qaida, in Iraq. There are 60 countries who have members of Al Qaida in them. How many of those countries are we going to invade? Not only that, he talks about Iran. The reality about Iran is that Iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch. They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans. Now, the vice president, as you pointed out, spoke out loudly for lifting the sanctions on Iraq. John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq, including closing the loophole that allows companies to use a subsidiary, offshore subsidiaries to do business with Iran. I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion, and you raised it in this question. This is relevant, because he was pushing for lifting sanctions when he was CEO of Halliburton. Here's why we didn't think Halliburton should have a no-bid contract. While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay. They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States. They're now under investigation for having bribed foreign officials during that period of time. Not only that, they've gotten a $7. 5 billion no-bid contract in Iraq, and instead of part of their money being withheld, which is the way it's normally done, because they're under investigation, they've continued to get their money.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," So, we don't think that's right.

"Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency. And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken. But we can't just provide moral support. We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites. But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies. Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges. And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place. The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners. We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time. You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute. And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation. So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen. We haven't been doing enough of that. We tend to be reactive. That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe. That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.

"Well, just listen to what you heard. [laughter]And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. But it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.

"Yes, I'd be glad to. Inflation. unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons. Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons. To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors. The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote. It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement. You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake. But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase. It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then. Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most. What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.

"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline. I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that. those imports have been reduced. And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1. 30. In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.

<claim> Mr. Movers, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline 15 months ago.</claim>
<premise> I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that. those imports have been reduced.</premise>
<premise> And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1. 30.</premise>
<premise> In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.</premise>
<claim> I have proposed we ought to take. put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.</claim>
<premise> Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments. their Social Security tax payments by 50%.</premise>
<premise> That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.</premise>
<premise> In addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, Mr. Movers, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, said that this is no time for a tax cut.</premise>"

"Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa. I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa. These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa. We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked. We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa. But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment. Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible. Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East. General Ridgway has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa. We should come to its defense. To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake. Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa. It leaves a hundred miles between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa. I think that uh - we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin. I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.","['O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise',

"Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus. I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House. And secondly, like my opponent, I don't agree we ought to have quotas. I agree, we shouldn't have quotas. But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there's Pell Grants available for them, which is what we've done. We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students. Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college? That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma. I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going.

"Again it's important to put the situation in perspective. In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. We had an even worse oil shock in 1979. In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War. In addition, we've brought down inflation. Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase. It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%. The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us. I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal. which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate. And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation. So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature. So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people. When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4. 8%, as you said. It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. It is now running at 12. 7%. President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created. Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs. But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months. Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%. Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less. We don't have inflation because the people are living too well. We have inflation because the Government is living too well. And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending. I see my time is running out here. I'll have to get this out very fast. Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.

<claim> Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.</claim>
<premise> When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4. 8%, as you said. It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. It is now running at 12. 7%.</premise>
<premise> President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created. Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs.</premise>
<claim> But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.</claim>
<premise> Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.</premise>
<claim> And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.</claim>
<premise> Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.</premise>
<claim> We don't have inflation because the people are living too well. We have inflation because the Government is living too well.</claim>
<premise> I see my time is running out here. I'll have to get this out very fast.</premise>
<claim> Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.</claim>
<claim> And my economic plan calls for that.</"

"Well, I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith. I think it's important and I share it. I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty. Everything is a gift from the Almighty. And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being. And people all find their ways to express it. I was taught -- I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself. And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet. We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America. There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have. And we're struggling with that today. And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith. I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead. I think we've got a lot more work to do. And as president, I will always respect everybody's right to practice religion as they choose -- or not to practice -- because that's part of America.","['O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise']"," But I also believe that we have a responsibility to help the poor, the downtrodden, the marginalized, and those who are suffering.

"Yes, I certainly do. (LAUGHTER) But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating. I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening. Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir. Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception. And the result is that you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other. Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't. I support it. I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things. The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things. No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it. I support it. I support the goals. But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion. Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers. You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here. So I complain about that.

"From historic Danville, Kentucky, good evening, and welcome to this year's only vice presidential debate sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm Bernard Shaw of CNN, moderator. Tonight we come to you from Newlin hall in the Norton Center for the Arts on the campus of Centre College. To President John Rausch, the faculty, students and community leaders state-wide, we thank you for hosting this debate. The candidates are the Republican nominee, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney of Wyoming, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. The Commission, these candidates and their campaign staffs have agreed to the following rules. A candidate shall have two minutes to respond to the moderator's question. The other candidate shall have two minutes to comment on the question or the first candidate's answer. When I exercise the moderator's discretion of extending discussion of a question, no candidate may speak for more than two minutes at one time. This audience has been told no disruptions will be tolerated. A prior coin toss has determined that the first question will go to the Democratic candidate. Senator, few hard working Americans would base their well-being on bonuses they hope to get five or ten years from now.

"Well, let's start with what we know. What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need -- dramatically different than the first Gulf War. We know that they haven't done it, and we know they can't do it. They didn't, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war. They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences. What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq -- and we have a plan for Iraq. They have a plan for Iraq too: more of the same. We have a plan for success. And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military. We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training. Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for what's happening. And by the way, if we need to, we can take Iraqis out of Iraq to train them. It is not secure enough. It's so dangerous on the ground that they can't be trained there. We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training. We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process. That works in conjunction with making sure the elections take place on time. Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there. Now, that's compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground. You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq. And they keep saying the election's on schedule, this is going to happen. The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success. Success breeds contribution, breeds joining the coalition. Not only that, I want to go back to what the vice president said. He attacks us about the troops. They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed. They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed. While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay.

"When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat. But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on. I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia. But it was a calculated risk that paid off. Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years. I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim. And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies. They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power.

And doing it the right way meant that we were prepared; that we gave the weapons inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction; that we didn't take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th. Now, remember, we went into Afghanistan, which, by the way, was the right thing to do. That was the right decision. And our military performed terrifically there. But we had Osama bin Laden cornered at Tora Bora. We had the 10th Mountain Division up in Uzbekistan available. We had the finest military in the world on the ground. And what did we do? We turned -- this is the man who masterminded the greatest mass murder and terrorist attack in American history. And what did the administration decide to do? They gave the responsibility of capturing and/or killing Saddam -- I mean Osama bin Laden to Afghan warlords who, just a few weeks before, had been working with Osama bin Laden. Our point in this is not complicated: We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama bin Laden. We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq. And these connections -- I want the American people to hear this very clearly. Listen carefully to what the vice president is saying. Because there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th -- period. The 9/11 Commission has said that's true. Colin Powell has said it's true. But the vice president keeps suggesting that there is. There is not. And, in fact, any connection with Al Qaida is tenuous at best.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"Yes, I'd be glad to. In the first place, uh - as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh - of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh - eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing - in things like housing, uh - pollution control, uh - crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, ""Ford to New York: Drop Dead."" I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh - the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh - tremendously. The last point is that the major - uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O',

"We agree on a couple of things on education. I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush. I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush. I'm in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance. Every school and every school district, have every state test the children. I've also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach. We've got to recruit 100,000 new teachers. And I have budgeted for that. We've got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher.

They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.

"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still. America is not standing still. It has not been standing still. And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say. He talks about housing. We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration. We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration. Let's talk about civil rights. More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before. He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like. We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one. Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America. He's been in some other country. Let's get that straight right away. Now the second point we have to understand is this, however. America has not been standing still. But America cannot stand pat. We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated. We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves. It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world. And this means more than what we've been doing. It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is. It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has. It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best. Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one. We had a good neighbor policy, yes. It sounded fine. But let's look at it. There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America. There are only three left. Let's look at Africa. Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration. Not one of them selected a Communist government. All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government. Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull? Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia? Of course not. What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side. We're on the side of freedom. We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice. But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements. Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead. One other point I would make: what could you do? Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States. And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president. What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president? It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster. It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people. In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great. And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong. See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O',

"Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself. But that's not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about. He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states. And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now he's decided it'll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union. We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault. But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.

"In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee. And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene. And he said this about it. He said, ""Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain. It's the sunrise side, not the sunset side. It's the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. "" I love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America. And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years. We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing. Over the next four years, we'll make sure the economy continues to grow. We reformed our school system, and now there's an achievement gap in America that's beginning to close. Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America. Over the next four years, we'll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable. Over the next four years, we'll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country's neighborhoods. I'm optimistic that we'll win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose. We must never waver in the face of this enemy that -- these ideologues of hate. And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty. We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world. My hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America and a safer world.

"Yes, Jim. I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country. And let me give you an example of what I mean. Under Governor Bush's tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined. Now, I think those are the wrong priorities. Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts. And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt. I think it's very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it. And I also think it's very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform. Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.

"Thank you. Thank you, Gwen. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here. You know, when I was young and growing up, I remember coming down the steps into the kitchen, early in the morning, and I would see the glow of the television. And I'd see my father sitting at a table. He wasn't paying bills, and he wasn't doing paperwork from work. What he was doing was learning math on television. Now, he didn't have a college education, but he was doing what he could do to get a better job in the mill where he worked. I was proud of him. I'm still proud of him. And I was also hopeful, because I knew that I lived in a country where I could get a college education. Here's the truth: I have grown up in the bright light of America. But that light is flickering today. Now, I know that the vice president and the president don't see it, but you do. You see it when your incomes are going down and the cost of everything -- college tuition, health care -- is going through the roof. You see it when you sit at your table each night and there's an empty chair because a loved one is serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. What they're going to give you is four more years of the same. John Kerry and I believe that we can do better. We believe in a strong middle-class in this country. That's why we have a plan to create jobs, getting rid of tax cuts for companies outsourcing your jobs; give tax cuts to companies that'll keep jobs here in America. That's why we have a health care plan. That's why we have a plan to keep you safe and to fix this mess in Iraq. The truth is that every four years you get to decide. You have the ability to decide where America's going to go. John Kerry and I are asking you to give us the power to fight for you, to fight to keep that dream in America, that I saw as a young man, alive for every parent sitting at that kitchen table.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"- reducing the interest rate. In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon- Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries. I think that's a good investment. I think we're going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise']","

"I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up. What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy. We've been very successful in both cases. We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago. This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history. We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Well, let me speak, first of all, to what the vice president just said, and then I'll answer that question. This, unfortunately -- what the vice president is telling people is inconsistent with everything they see every single day. It's a continuation of, ""Well, there's a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein."" It's not true. It's a continuation of at least insinuating that there's some connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein. It's not true. It's saying to the American people, as the president said last Thursday, and the vice president continues to say tonight, that things are going well in Iraq, contrary to what people who have been there have seen, including Republican leaders, contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day -- Americans being kidnapped, people being beheaded, parts of the country under the control of insurgents, even today, under the control of the insurgents. The vice president has still not said anything about what Mr. Bremer said, about the failure to have adequate troops, the failure to be able to secure the country in the short term. You know, remember ""shock and awe""? Look at where we are now. It is a direct result of the failure to plan, the failure to have others involved in this effort. This is not an accident. Now, let me go back to your question. If we want to do the things that need to be done to keep this country safe, we can't be dragged kicking and screaming to it. One thing that everybody does agree on is that 9/11 did change things. But what's happened is this administration opposed the creation of a 9/11 Commission to find out why it happened and what we needed to do. They opposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, and then they were for it. We can't react that way. We must be more aggressive. With John Kerry as president of the United States, we are committed to immediately implementing all of the reforms suggested by the 9/11 Commission, so that we have the information we need to find terrorists and crush them before they hurt us.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Two points. One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut. I remember the vice president saying, ""Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts."" It didn't happen. Now he's having to say that again. They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you. Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget. The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures. It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion. That means he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion. This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people. His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents.

"Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that. Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But let's look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace. We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is. When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say. Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.

"Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended. There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa. Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun. Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again. So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa. What do we do then? My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war. We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II. We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again. That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955. And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve. The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history. And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this - change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable. The road to war is always paved with good intentions. And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace. But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise',

"First of all, I'm not familiar with his cases. My concern is specifically with what's happened to our medical care system because of rising malpractice insurance rates, because we failed to adequately reform our medical liability structure. I was in New Mexico the other day and met with a group of OB/GYN docs. And they were deeply concerned because they were fearful that there'd be another increase in malpractice insurance rates as a result of what they believe are frivolous lawsuits and that that would put them out of business. And one doctor indicated that her rates have gone up so much that she's now to the point where she is screening patients. She won't take high-risk patients anymore because of the danger that that will generate a lawsuit, and a lawsuit will put her out of business. This has had a devastating impact in a lot of communities. My home state of Wyoming, we've lost the top insurer of malpractice insurance in the state. The rates for a general practitioner have gone from $40,000 a year to $100,000 a year for an insurance policy. We think this has a devastating impact on the quality of health care. As I say, high risk patients don't get covered anymore. We've lost one out of eleven OB/GYN practitioners in the country. We think it can be fixed, needs to be fixed. Now, specifically, what we need to do is cap non-economic damages, and we also think you need to limit the awards that the trial attorneys take out of all of this. Over 50 percent of the settlements go to the attorneys and for administrating overhead. We passed medical liability reform through the House of Representatives. It's been blocked in the Senate. Senator Kerry's voted 10 times against medical liability reform, and I don't believe Senator Edwards supports it, either, not the kind that would be meaningful.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy. Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.

But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.

"Well, Gwen, there are several things that I think need to be done and are being done. We've, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack. But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president's already working on. I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs. There's no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family. To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business. And that means we've got to deal effectively with tax policy. We've got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society. We've got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process. I'd zero in, in particular, on education. I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system. I'm a product of public schools. And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act. It was the first piece of legislation we introduced. We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis. We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort. And it does several things. It establishes high standards. It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing. And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education.

<claim>Well, Gwen, there are several things that I think need to be done and are being done.</claim>
<premise>We've, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack.</premise>
<claim>But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president's already working on.</claim>
<premise>I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs.</premise>
<claim>There's no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family.</claim>
<premise>To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business.</premise>
<premise>And that means we've got to deal effectively with tax policy.</premise>
<premise>We've got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society.</premise>
<premise>We've got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process.</premise>
<claim>I'd zero in, in particular, on education.</claim>
<premise>I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system.</premise>
<claim>I'm a product of public schools.</claim>
<premise>And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act.</premise>
<premise>It was the first piece of legislation we introduced.</premise>
<premise>We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis.</premise>
<premise>We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort.</premise>

<premise>It establishes high standards.</premise>
<premise>It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so"

"Yes. Well let me say, first of all, I'm proud of the work I did on behalf of kids and families against big insurance companies, big drug companies and big HMOs. We do have too many lawsuits. And the reality is there's something that we can do about it. John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it. We want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require, before a case, malpractice, which the vice president just spoke about, have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed; hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they don't do it; have a three-strikes-and-you're-out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases. That way we keep the cases out of the system that don't belong in the system. They talk about frivolous cases. We believe cases that don't belong in the system should never be in the system. But we don't believe that we should take away the right of people like Valerie Lakey, who was the young girl who I represented, five years old, severely injured for life, on a defective swimming pool drain cover. It turns out the company knew of 12 other children who had either been killed or severely injured by the same problem. They hid it. They didn't tell anybody. They could have fixed it with a 2-cent screw. That's wrong.

"First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible. I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life. I've been President now for almost four years. I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way. And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could. As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society that's just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world. I believe that since I've been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one. The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not. There is a partnership involved in our nation. To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"The American people want in their president and in their vice president basically three things: They want to know that their president and their vice president will keep them safe. They want to know that they have good judgment. And they want to know that you'll tell them the truth. John Kerry and I will tell the American people the truth. During the time that I have served on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, traveling to some of the places we've talked about tonight -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East, Turkey -- meeting with the leaders of NATO, I have a very clear idea of what has to be done to keep this country safe. The threats we face: terrorism, killing terrorists and stopping them before they can do damage to us, making sure that we stop the spread of nuclear weapons. I agree with John Kerry from Thursday night, that the danger of nuclear weapons getting in the hands of terrorists is one of the greatest threats that America faces. But the one thing that we know from this administration is -- and I -- first of all, I don't claim to have the long political resume that Vice President Cheney has. That's just the truth, and the American people know that and deserve to know it. But what we know from this administration is that a long resume does not equal good judgment.

"Thank you. One thing that's very clear is that a long resume does not equal good judgment. I mean, we've seen over and over and over the misjudgments made by this administration. I want to go back to what the vice president just said, because it's a continuation of the things he's been doing, unfortunately, on the campaign trail; it's a continuation of what he began his first answer with tonight. John Kerry has voted for the biggest military appropriations bill in the country's history. John Kerry has voted for the biggest intelligence appropriations in the country's history. This vice president, when he was secretary of defense, cut over 80 weapons systems, including the very ones he's criticizing John Kerry for voting against. These are weapons systems, a big chunk of which, the vice president himself suggested we get rid of after the Cold War. The reality is that John Kerry has consistently supported the very men that he served with in Vietnam and led. On the $87 billion, it was clear at the time of that vote that they had no plan to win the peace. We're seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now.

"Well, let's start with what we know. What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need -- dramatically different than the first Gulf War. We know that they haven't done it, and we know they can't do it. They didn't, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war. They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences. What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq -- and we have a plan for Iraq. They have a plan for Iraq too: more of the same. We have a plan for success. And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military. We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training. Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for what's happening. And by the way, if we need to, we can take Iraqis out of Iraq to train them. It is not secure enough. It's so dangerous on the ground that they can't be trained there. We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training. We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process. That works in conjunction with making sure the elections take place on time. Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there. Now, that's compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground. You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq. And they keep saying the election's on schedule, this is going to happen. The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success. Success breeds contribution, breeds joining the coalition. Not only that, I want to go back to what the vice president said. He attacks us about the troops. They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed. They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed. While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay. This is the height of hypocrisy.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," They don't care about the troops.

"We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results. Let me give you a story about public education, if I might. It's about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas. A charter school run by some people from Teach For America. Young folks saying I'm going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so-called at-risk children. It's how we unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they can't learn. It's a school of strong discipline and high standards. It's one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. That's what we do. And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas. That's my vision for public education all around America. Many of you viewers don't know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers. Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans.

"Someone did get it wrong. But it wasn't John Kerry and John Edwards. They got it wrong. When we had Osama bin Laden cornered, they left the job to the Afghan warlords. They then diverted their attention from the very people who attacked us, who were at the center of the war on terror, and so Osama bin Laden is still at large. Now, I want to go back to something the vice president said just a minute ago, because these distortions are continuing. He said that -- made mention of this global test. What John Kerry said -- and it's just as clear as day to anybody who was listening -- he said: We will find terrorists where they are and kill them before they ever do harm to the American people, first.

"Well, let me speak, first of all, to what the vice president just said, and then I'll answer that question. This, unfortunately -- what the vice president is telling people is inconsistent with everything they see every single day. It's a continuation of, ""Well, there's a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein."" It's not true. It's a continuation of at least insinuating that there's some connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein. It's not true. It's saying to the American people, as the president said last Thursday, and the vice president continues to say tonight, that things are going well in Iraq, contrary to what people who have been there have seen, including Republican leaders, contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day -- Americans being kidnapped, people being beheaded, parts of the country under the control of insurgents, even today, under the control of the insurgents. The vice president has still not said anything about what Mr. Bremer said, about the failure to have adequate troops, the failure to be able to secure the country in the short term. You know, remember ""shock and awe""? Look at where we are now. It is a direct result of the failure to plan, the failure to have others involved in this effort. This is not an accident. Now, let me go back to your question. If we want to do the things that need to be done to keep this country safe, we can't be dragged kicking and screaming to it. One thing that everybody does agree on is that 9/11 did change things.

<claim> Well, let me speak, first of all, to what the vice president just said, and then I'll answer that question.</claim>
<claim> This, unfortunately -- what the vice president is telling people is inconsistent with everything they see every single day.</claim>
<claim> It's a continuation of, ""Well, there's a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein."" It's not true.</claim>
<claim> It's a continuation of at least insinuating that there's some connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein. It's not true.</claim>
<claim> It's saying to the American people, as the president said last Thursday, and the vice president continues to say tonight, that things are going well in Iraq, contrary to what people who have been there have seen, including Republican leaders, contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day -- Americans being kidnapped, people being beheaded, parts of the country under the control of insurgents, even today, under the control of the insurgents.</claim>
<claim> The vice president has still not said anything about what Mr. Bremer said, about the failure to have adequate troops, the failure to be able to secure the country in the short term.</claim>
<claim> You know, remember ""shock and awe""? Look at where we are now. It is a direct result of the failure to plan, the failure to have others involved in this effort.</claim>
<claim> Now, let me go back to your question.</claim>
<claim> If we want to do the things that need to be done to keep this country safe, we can't be dragged kicking and screaming to it.</claim>
<claim> One thing that everybody does agree on is that 9/11 did change things.</claim>
<claim> But what's happened is this administration opposed the creation of a 9/11 Commission to find out why it happened and what we needed to do.</claim>

"Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent. That's untrue. The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread. Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents. The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can. And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better. But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error. The Vice President suggested a number of things. He suggested that we aid distressed areas. The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice. He suggested we pass an aid to education bill. But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education. And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added. This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959. And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more. Governor Rockefeller says five per cent. The Democratic platform and others say five per cent. Many say four and a half per cent. The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.

"First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible. That's why I strongly supported the Motor Voter law. There was a big story I think in U. S. A. Today of the millions of people who have now registered because of it. Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible. You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks. A lot of people are busy and it's hard for them to just get there and vote. Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform. Because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways, because what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing. And if you open the airways to more things like this, you see it's not just you that are participating here. For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you there's a 100,000 Americans who said I wish I could have asked that question. So I think we have to change the nature of politics. The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here. Those are my best ideas about it.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise']","

"Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues. But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, ""view,"" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.

"Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country. When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test. And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions. Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9. And there were reports. public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews. I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short. But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living. And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time. And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today. And I think that's shocking; it's shameful. So, yes, I told the American Legion National! Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses. That only makes sense.

<claim>Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.</claim>
<claim>And there were reports. public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews.</claim>
<claim>But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.</claim>
<claim>And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today. And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.</claim>
<claim>So, yes, I told the American Legion National! Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses. That only makes sense.</claim>
<claim>But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.</claim>
<premise>When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test:</premise>
<premise>that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.</premise>
<premise>In most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions.</"

"I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after ""read my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed. But the main thing is he still didn't get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond. They don't want us talking about each other. They want us to talk about the problems of this country. I don't think he'll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it, and what he's saying about my program is just not true. Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me. High tech executives in Northern California. Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.

"Let's talk about this question of the surplus because it drives a lot of what we're talking about here, Joe. If you look at our proposal, we take half of the projected surplus and set it aside for Social Security. Over $2. 4 trillion. We take roughly a fourth of it for other urgent priorities such as Medicare reform and education, several of these other key programs we want to support. And we take roughly one-fourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the American taxpayer. We think it's extraordinarily important to do that. It is a fundamental difference between our two approaches. If you look, frankly, by our numbers and the numbers of the Senate Budget Committee, which has totaled up all the promises that Vice President Gore has made during the course of the campaign, they are some $900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already and we still have a month to go in the campaign. The fact is that the program that we put together we think is very responsible. Suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isn't true. Another way to look at it is over the course of the next ten years we'll collect roughly $25 trillion in revenue. We want to take about 5% of that and return that to the American taxpayer in the form of tax relief. We have the highest level of taxation now we've had since World War II. The average American family is paying about 40% in federal, state and local taxes. We think it is appropriate to return to the American people so that they can make choices themselves in how that money ought to be spent; whether on education, retirement or on paying their bills.

And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five. We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it. All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate. Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate. It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives. It was killed in the Rules Committee. And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House. Four Democrats voted for it. Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security. We wanted to tie it to Social Security. We offered an amendment to do so. Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it. And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it. In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs. But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet. And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about. The American people want arms control. They don't want this arms race. And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world. The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down. And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children. The American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment. The American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.

"Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country. I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly. Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough. Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want. We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America. It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle. Now, what do we do about it? And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion. So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy. In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth. I refer, for example, to distressed areas. We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas. We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately. That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need. And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth. Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still. Let's get that straight. Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America. He's been traveling in some other country. We have been moving. We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years. But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.","['O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim',

<claim> Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.</claim>
<claim> I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.</claim>
<claim> Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.</claim>
<claim> America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.</claim>
<claim> We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America.</claim>
<claim> It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.</claim>
<claim> Now, what do we do about it?</claim>
<claim> And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.</claim>
<claim> So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.</claim>
<claim> In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.</claim>
<claim> I refer, for example, to distressed areas. We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.</claim>
<claim> We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.</claim>
<claim> That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.</claim>
<claim> And in addition"

"The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan. He says he's for voluntary testing. You can't have voluntary testing. You must have mandatory testing. You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract. That's the difference. You may claim you've got mandatory testing but you don't, Mr. Vice President. That's a huge difference. Testing is the cornerstone of reform. You know how I know? Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas. Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country? We've done a long way working together to do so. The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility. We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet. We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools. We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas. I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won't teach, we need to free the parents. We need to expand education savings accounts.

"Because we will do what they've not done. You know, if you look at what's happened over the last four years, we have gone from a $5 trillion projected surplus when George Bush took office to a $3 trillion projected deficit. They promised they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus aside from Social Security. Not done. Not only that, it's the biggest fiscal turnaround in American history. And there's no end in sight. The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what they're going to do about it. John Kerry and I believe we have a moral responsibility not to leave trillions of debt to our children and our grandchildren. So here's what we're going to do, to answer your question. To pay for the things that we believe need to be done -- and I hope to get the chance to talk about health care and also about education, because we have plans on both of those subjects -- what we're going to do is roll back tax cuts. And I want everyone to hear this, because there have been exaggerations made on the campaign trail: Roll back tax cuts for people who make over $200,000 a year; we will do that. We want to keep the tax cuts that are in place for people who make less than $200,000 a year and give additional tax cuts to those middle-class families, tax cuts for health care, tax cuts to help families pay for their college tuition, tax cuts for child care. These families are struggling and hurting, and they need more tax relief, not less tax relief. But to help get us back on the path to a balanced budget, we also want to get rid of some of the bureaucratic spending in Washington. One of the amazing things that's happened is they've actually layered on more supervisory people, people at the supervisory level, in this government. We also want to close some corporate loopholes.

<claim>We will do what they've not done.</claim>
<premise>If you look at what's happened over the last four years, we have gone from a $5 trillion projected surplus when George Bush took office to a $3 trillion projected deficit.</premise>
<premise>They promised they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus aside from Social Security. Not done.</premise>
<premise>It's the biggest fiscal turnaround in American history.</premise>
<premise>And there's no end in sight.</premise>
<premise>The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what they're going to do about it.</premise>

<premise>To pay for the things that we believe need to be done -- and I hope to get the chance to talk about health care and also about education, because we have plans on both of those subjects -- what we're going to do is roll back tax cuts.</premise>

<premise>we want to keep the tax cuts that are in place for people who make less than $200,000 a year</premise>
<claim>and give additional tax cuts to those middle-class families, tax cuts for health care, tax cuts to help families pay for their college tuition, tax cuts for child care.</claim>
<premise>These families are struggling and hurting, and they need more tax relief, not less tax relief.</premise>
<premise>But to help get us back on the path to a balanced budget, we also want to get rid of some of the bureaucratic spending in Washington.</premise>

"Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant. But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else. So let's talk about abortion and choice. Let's talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That's something we trust American women to do that. And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion. Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided.

"If I could respond to that. Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare.

I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he'll put Medicare in a lockbox. I donaEUR(tm)t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers A $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut. Now here is the difference.

"These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country.

"Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955. The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands. Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed. The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw. I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands. General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States. The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish. Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible. Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw. Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position. And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa. I support that. In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take. That's not the position you took, however. The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands. Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands. And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future. On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce. We can't settle for anything but the best. And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce. And that means that we can't have any test of religion. We can't have any test of race. It must be a test of a man.

"Yes. Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges. I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for four ears and not one single state - and most f them have a majority of Democratic legislators - has added to the ratification r voted to ratify the equal rights amendment. While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.

A coup broke out in the Philippines. I had to go to the situation room. I had to assemble the president's advisers. I talked to President Aquino. I made the recommendation to the president. The president made the decision, the coup was suppressed, democracy continued in the Philippines, the situation was ended. I've been there. And I'll tell you one other thing that qualifies you for being president -- and it's this, Hal -- you've got to stand up for what you believe in.

The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.

I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace. I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success. We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris. There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up. He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference.

"Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.

"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position. I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can. The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion. It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy. And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth. As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States. And we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place. And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged. So, I think some of those charges are missing the point. I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.

"Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob. I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process. And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out. But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help. Number one, let's focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America. Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis. Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners. That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages. I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.

<claim>Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight.</claim>
<claim>I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.</claim>
<claim>And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step.</claim>
<premise>Making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.</premise>
<premise>Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.</premise>
<claim>What we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.</claim>
<claim>Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.</claim>
<claim>So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.</claim>
<claim>Number one, let's focus on jobs.</claim>
<claim>I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas</claim>
<claim>and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.</claim>
<claim>Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut</claim>
<claim>-- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000,</claim>
<claim>and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.</claim>
<claim>Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.</claim>
<claim>That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.</claim>
<claim>I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.</claim>
<claim>And we don't want to waste taxpayer money.</claim>
<claim>And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.</claim>

"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position. I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.

And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.

"Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region. Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida. This is an area where I've led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia. But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America? And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.","['O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military-style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.","['O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"No, I do not. And, Gwen, at the time, I was talking specifically about this question of unilateral sanctions. What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there's a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don't have any impact, except to penalize American companies. We've got sanctions on Iran now. We may well want to go to the U. N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don't live up to their obligations under the initial -- International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty. We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U. N. Security Council. We're working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who've been negotiating with the Iranians. We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency. And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran's living up to their commitments and obligations. And if they aren't, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U. N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go. We're addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around. One of the great by-products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done. This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that. The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A. Q. Khan, has been shut down. We've made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation.

"Miss Quinn, I don't have to. I've done it. We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7. 5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, John's been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5. 7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan. But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget. We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those. perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government. I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production. And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation. And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money. You are robbing the American people of their savings. And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings. Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight. But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on. I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections. conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget. We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," So, if we reduce that tax increase, we're still going to have a substantial tax increase.

"Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years. Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend. But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me. Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27. 5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter. I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible. That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation. Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry. What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11. 3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget. I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.

"I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile. This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship. This has not been an ancient history story. Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile. Another point I wanna make is this. He says we have to move from one area of the world to another. That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy. While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement. We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems. Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war. Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war. Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism. I don't agree with that statement. I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either. He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium. And the last thing I wanna make is this. He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace. We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office. But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"Well, it starts with enforcing law. When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you. If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law. And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And I'm going to make it a priority. Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them. That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas I tried to do something innovative. There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. I support that. But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. He is for registration of guns. I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I. D. card. It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.

"Well, first, uh - let me set the record straight. I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs. Number two, that strip-mining bill would've severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh - Arab oil supply. So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would've interfered with our energy independence program. The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified. But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment. I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution. I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program. Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.

"I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are. I do know what he has said about mine. And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security. Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it. Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us. And to maintain that peace requires strength. America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong. We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carter's, until we're faced each time with a crisis. And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis. I have seen four wars in my lifetime.

"No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasn't done. But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil. So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem. What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.","['O', 'O', 'B-Premise',

"Well Gwen, two years ago Barack Obama warned about the sub prime mortgage crisis. John McCain said shortly after that in December he was surprised there was a sub prime mortgage problem. John McCain while Barack Obama was warning about what we had to do was literally giving an interview to ""The Wall Street Journal"" saying that I'm always for cutting regulations. We let Wall Street run wild. John McCain and he's a good man, but John McCain thought the answer is that tried and true Republican response, deregulate, deregulate. So what you had is you had overwhelming ""deregulation."" You had actually the belief that Wall Street could self-regulate itself. And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation. As a matter of fact, John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry. So deregulation was the promise. And guess what? Those people who say don't go into debt, they can barely pay to fill up their gas tank. I was recently at my local gas station and asked a guy named Joey Danco (ph). I said Joey, how much did it cost to fill your tank? You know what his answer was? He said I don't know, Joe.

"Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right. This uh - administration's record on environment is very bad. Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country. The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh - hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh - supporting the bill. And I don't think they would have supported the uh - bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs. There's been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would've gone to uh - cities and others to control uh - water pollution. We have no energy policy. We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh - energy uh - forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor. The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean. We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh - geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment. Uh - the lands that Mr. Ford uh - brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh - in size. But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it's very uh - far in the future. We've taken no strong position in the uh - control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh - threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation. And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.

"As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy. Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it. I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age. But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way. And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.

"I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that. It - my view is the same as his. Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add. That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength. If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions. Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin. It's going to be a test of our nerve and will. It's going to be a test of our strength. And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty. On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon.

"Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future. And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers. But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration. I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies. And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers. I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time. Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers. But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.

"Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office. And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process. I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford. I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions. H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible and wrong. The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased. Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all. Since I've been in office, we've had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense. But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace. We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others. In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability. This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past. I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature. There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests. That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves. That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.","['O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise']","

"I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America. Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area. To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area. That's one of the big disagreements that we have with the President -- that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within El Salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about. I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents. A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power. We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America's assets. But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger. The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead. And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command. A President is called the Commander in Chief. And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.","['B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise']","

"No. I think we've both said the same thing all along. We both believe that -- and this goes onto the end of what I just talked about -- we both believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. But we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long-term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits. For example, a gay couple now has a very difficult time, one, visiting the other when they're in the hospital, or, for example, if, heaven forbid, one of them were to pass away, they have trouble even arranging the funeral. I mean, those are not the kind of things that John Kerry and I believe in. I suspect the vice president himself does not believe in that. But we don't -- we do believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. And I want to go back, if I can, to the question you just asked, which is this constitutional amendment. I want to make sure people understand that the president is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage that is completely unnecessary. Under the law of this country for the last 200 years, no state has been required to recognize another state's marriage. Let me just be simple about this. My state of North Carolina would not be required to recognize a marriage from Massachusetts, which you just asked about. There is absolutely no purpose in the law and in reality for this amendment. It's nothing but a political tool. And it's being used in an effort to divide this country on an issue that we should not be dividing America on.

"No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along. And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along. I'll give you an example. I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time. I was chairman of it once. Now I'm the senior Democrat on it. We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country. They don't reach those goals. They don't even fight to reach those goals. They've tried to undo them. The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination. And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color. Some people have a mistaken view of it in America. It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country. I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably. If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time. During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action. And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching. So we had a policy called ""Mend it, don't end it. ""We fixed it. And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel. As president, I will make certain we travel it. Now, let me just share something. This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP. This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus. This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country. If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers? I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible. I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates. But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country. Next Tuesday is Election Day. Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision. I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as itwas? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have. This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in. We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing. We talk about the unemployment lines. If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California. All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved. I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make. I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today. I know because we did it there. We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years. We returned $5. 7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people. We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that. And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people. I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help. And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.

"Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question. First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described. This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations. The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America. This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it. Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

<claim>Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.</claim>
<premise>First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described.</premise>
<claim>This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.</claim>
<premise>The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.</premise>

"Two points. One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut. I remember the vice president saying, ""Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts."" It didn't happen. Now he's having to say that again. They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you. Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget. The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures. It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion. That means he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion. This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people. His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents.

"Am I personally attacked? I think the truth is that what they're doing is talking about an issue that really doesn't have a great deal to do with what's happening with medical cost in this country, which I think is a very serious issue. And I would be the first to say that what the vice president described a few minutes ago, problems with malpractice premiums, that's true, it's real. It's very real. What doctors talk about is very serious. And they're getting squeezed from both sides. I mean, because, they have trouble getting reimbursed, first of all, for the care that they provide, you know, from the government or from health-care companies. And, on the flip side, their malpractice costs are going up. That's very real, which is why we have proposed a plan to keep cases out of the system that don't belong there. But it's very important to put this in context. Because, in context, everything they're proposing, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office, amounts to about half of 1 percent of health-care costs in this country -- half of 1 percent. We have double-digit inflation in health care costs. We've seen the largest rise in medical costs in the last four years in the country's history: $3,500 nationally. And nobody who's watching this debate needs me to explain this to them. They know it. Medicare premiums are up 17 percent on their watch. Again, largest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of Medicare. We think we have a plan to keep cases that don't belong in the system out, but we also do what they haven't done. Five million Americans have lost their health care coverage. Medical costs are skyrocketing. We have a serious health care plan to bring down costs for everybody, to cover millions more Americans and to actually stand up to drug companies and insurance companies which this administration has been unwilling to do.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no-fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say. And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about taking guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.

"I'm saying specifically that I don't believe he has the qualities we need in a commander in chief because I don't think, based on his record, that he would pursue the kind of aggressive policies that need to be pursued if we're going to defeat these terrorists. We need to battle them overseas so we don't have to battle them here at home. I'm not challenging John Kerry's patriotism. I said in my acceptance speech in New York City at the Republican convention that we respected his service in Vietnam, and I got applause for that. We've never criticized his patriotism. What we've questioned is his judgment. And his judgment's flawed, and the record's there for anybody who wants to look at it. In 1984, when he ran for the Senate he opposed, or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the Cold War and are important today to our overall forces. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and occupied it in 1990 and '91, he stood up on the floor of the Senate and voted against going in to liberate Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back to Iraq. The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn't display the qualities of somebody who has conviction. And with respect to this particular operation, we've seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war, John Edwards and John Kerry, then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed -- body armor, spare parts, ammunition -- they voted against it. I couldn't figure out why that happened initially. And then I looked and figured out that what was happening was Howard Dean was making major progress in the Democratic primaries, running away with the primaries based on an anti-war record. So they, in effect, decided they would cast an anti-war vote and they voted against the troops.

"Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.

<claim>Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country.</claim>
<claim>Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.</claim>
<claim>We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.</claim>
<claim>We've got to do several things at the same time.</claim>
<claim>We have to restore trust between communities and the police.</claim>
<claim>We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.</claim>
<claim>Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.</claim>
<claim>Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.</claim>
<claim>So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.</claim>
<claim>I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.</claim>
<claim>But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.</claim>
<claim>So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.</claim>
<claim>And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.</claim>

"Gwen, I want to thank you. It's been a privilege to serve as your vice president these last four years and to work alongside President Bush to put our economy on an upward path. We've cut taxes, added 1. 7 million new jobs in the last year, and we'll continue to provide opportunities for business and for workers. We won't be happy until every American who wants to work can find a job. We believe that all Americans ought to have access to available -- to medical care and that they ought to have access to the finest schools in the world. We'll do everything we can to preserve Social Security and to make certain that it's there for future generations. I've worked for four presidents and watched two others up close, and I know that there's no such thing as a routine day in the Oval Office. We saw on 9/11 that the next president -- next decision a president has to make can affect the lives of all of us. Now we find ourselves in the midst of a conflict unlike any we've ever known, faced with the possibility that terrorists could smuggle a deadly biological agent or a nuclear weapon into the middle of one of our own cities. That threat -- and the presidential leadership needed to deal with it -- is placing a special responsibility on all of you who will decide on November 2nd who will be our commander in chief. The only viable option for winning the war on terrorism is the one the president has chosen, to use the power of the United States to aggressively go after the terrorists wherever we find them and also to hold to account states that sponsor terror. Now that we've captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida and taken down the regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban, it's important that we stand up democratically elected governments as the only guarantee that they'll never again revert to terrorism or the production of deadly weapons. This is the task of our generation. And I know firsthand the strength the president brings to it. The overall outcome will depend upon the ability of the American people and the strong leadership of the president to meet all the challenges that we'll face in the days and years ahead. I'm confident we can do it.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," Thank you, Gwen.

"Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision. They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug. This is indeed a very important issue. First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk. That's not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a woman's right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.

"Well obviously my views are a little different. First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led. I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans. It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee. I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark. When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress. Because let's consider it. If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue? The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them. It was because they were too extreme. And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.","['B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine. It's an easy one. I'm really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days. And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone. For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that. When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law. And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.

"Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question. First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described. This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations. The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America. This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it. Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums. Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it. Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest. It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business. We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way. And so I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride. On looking specifically at the Arkansas record -- he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent, fine. But he's an incumbent, and we've got to look at all the facts. They're almost at the bottom on every single category. We can't do that to the American people. And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group. And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office. It doesn't work that way when you're president. Truman is right. The buck stops there. And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest. And I've done that. It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time. So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience. And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that.

<claim>Well, I think the answer to why the drop</claim> <claim>, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.</claim>
<claim>Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.</claim>
<claim>Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest.</claim>
<claim>It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business.</claim>
<claim>We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way.</claim>
<claim>And so I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride.</claim>
<claim>On looking specifically at the Arkansas record -- he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent, fine. But he's an incumbent, and we've got to look at all the facts.</claim>
<claim>They're almost at the bottom on every single category.</claim>
<claim>We can't do that to the American people.</claim>
<claim>And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.</claim>
<claim>And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.</claim>
<claim>It doesn't work that way when you're president.</claim>
<claim>Truman is right. The buck stops there.</claim>
<claim>And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.</claim>
<claim>And I've done that.</claim>

"You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have. It's their ingenuity, I agree with that. But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago. And now they had ingenuity eight years ago. The difference is we've got a new policy. And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families. We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses. We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market. Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs. It's not good enough. Too many people have been left behind. We have got to do much more. The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.

"First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his. Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union. And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland. This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them. In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union. Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had. I would just like to s- add this one point.

"Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed. He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains. There isn't any doubt about that, number one. Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral. They have to include the other countries of Latin America. The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe. If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro. That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others. Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America. The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia. We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America. His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine. His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.

"Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present. I. too, believe in the voluntary military. As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees. I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work. Recognize that we have a voluntary military. We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment. And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he's earning less for himself and his family, while he's away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home. As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G. I. Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education. In 1977, we took that away from the military. That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up. So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them. Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate. We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment. Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people. The other day, I just - I'll hasten - I just saw one example. Down in Texas. I saw a high school that is military.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," It's a public high school.

"Well, Gwen, it's hard to know where to start; there are so many inaccuracies there. The fact of the matter is the troops wouldn't have what they have today if you guys had had your way.

"Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened. I am. But let's look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.","['O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","

"If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider. If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man. I am results oriented. I am action oriented. I've dealt my businesses. Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do. Everybody says you can't do that with Congress. Sure, you can do that with Congress. Congress -- they're all good people. They're all patriots but you've got to link arms and work with them. Sure, you'll have arguments. Sure, you'll have fights. We have them all day every day. But we get the job done. Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education. I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children. And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3. Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born. Starting when they're 3 and going to this school until they're 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade. Ninety percent are on the honor role. Now that will change America. Those children will all go to college. They will live the American dream. And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom. And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific. Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water. And we have got to put our nation back to work. Now, if you don't want to really do that I'm not your man. I'd go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one. In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it. Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess.

"No. I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher. Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes. You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream. Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich.

"Yes. We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done very well. As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago. We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office. At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved. Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history. The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years. And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.

"I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point. I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well. Generals testified to that. And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States. I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war. But it didn't mean that. We had to go in when they came in. Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant. It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important. It's the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're a- they're after Formosa. In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea. I am against it.

"I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did. In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: ""The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area."" That was done with much thought and deliberation. Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area. I completely sustained the treaty. I voted for it. I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island. What we're now talking about is the Vice President's determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area. I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments. Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959. General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: ""To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant."" So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.

<claim>I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did.</claim>
<premise>In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: ""The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area."" That was done with much thought and deliberation.</premise>
<premise>Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.</premise>
<claim>I completely sustained the treaty. I voted for it. I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island.</claim>
<premise>What we're now talking about is the Vice President's determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area.</premise>
<claim>I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments.</claim>
<premise>Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959.</premise>
<premise>General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: ""To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant.""</premise>
<claim>So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.</claim>
<premise>I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war.</premise>
<claim>I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.</claim>

"Our policies are very different. I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign. In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista. Now let's just see what this means. We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise. The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another. Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without. But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective. I know something else. It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that. This is the major recommendation that he's made. Now, what can we do? Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala. There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration. We quarantined Mr. Arbenz. The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out. We are quarantining Mr. Castro today. We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy's suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong. We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive. By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro. But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim',

"Well, first, with respect to what's happening in Africa and Russia and in other places around the world, the vice president spoke about the $15 billion for AIDS. John Kerry and I believe that needs to be doubled. And I might add, on the first year of their commitment, they came up significantly short of what they had promised. And we probably won't get a chance to talk about Africa. Let me just say a couple of things. The AIDS epidemic in Africa, which is killing millions and millions of people and is a frightening thing not just for the people of Africa but also for the rest of the world, that, combined with the genocide that we're now seeing in Sudan, are two huge moral issues for the United States of America, which John Kerry spoke about eloquently last Thursday night. Here at home we need to do much more. And the vice president spoke about doing research, making sure we have the drugs available, making sure that we do everything possible to have prevention. But it's a bigger question than that. You know, we have 5 million Americans who've lost their health care coverage in the last four years; 45 million Americans without health care coverage. We have children who don't have health care coverage. If kids and adults don't have access to preventative care, if they're not getting the health care that they need day after day after day, the possibility of not only developing AIDS and having a problem -- having a problem -- a life-threatening problem, but the problem of developing other life-threatening diseases is there every day of their lives.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']"," So we need to do something about this.

"Why I am different from John Edwards. Well, in some respects, I think, probably there are more similarities than there are differences in our personal story. I don't talk about myself very much, but I've heard Senator Edwards, and as I listen to him, I find some similarities. I come from relatively modest circumstances. My grandfather never even went to high school. I'm the first in my family to graduate from college. I carried a ticket in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for six years. I've been laid off, been hospitalized without health insurance. So I have some idea of the problems that people encounter. So I think the personal stories are, in some respects, surprisingly similar. With respect to how we've spent our careers, I obviously made a choice for public service. And I've been at it for a good long time now, except for those periods when we lost elections. And that goes with the turf, as well, too. I'm absolutely convinced that the threat we face now, the idea of a terrorist in the middle of one of our cities with a nuclear weapon, is very real and that we have to use extraordinary measures to deal with it. I feel very strongly that the significance of 9/11 cannot be underestimated. It forces us to think in new ways about strategy, about national security, about how we structure our forces and about how we use U. S. military power. Some people say we should wait until we are attacked before we use force. I would argue we've already been attacked. We lost more people on 9/11 than we lost at Pearl Harbor.

"Oh, absolutely. This is a very important moment in the history of our country. Look, we've got the biggest surpluses in all of American history. The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few. Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush's plan, go to the wealthiest 1%. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices. I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies. I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to. I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage. I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012. I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox. The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox. I don't think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs. I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected. I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare. Now, the priorities are just very different. I'll give you a couple of examples. For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Those are very clear differences.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver. When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver. Well, we've seen what has happened. We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term. Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%. And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be. Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information. He went so far as to call it ""brutal economics."" I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first. I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done. But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference. Somebody worked it out. And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more. So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.

<claim>Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost.</claim>
<premise>because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.</premise>
<claim>When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver.</claim>
<premise>Well, we've seen what has happened.</premise>
<premise>We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised;</premise>
<premise>we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.</premise>
<premise>Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.</premise>
<premise>And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.</premise>
<claim>Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.</claim>
<premise>His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.</premise>
<premise>He went so far as to call it ""brutal economics.""</premise>
<claim>I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.</claim>
<premise>I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.</premise>
<premise>But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference.</prem"

"Well, thank you, Senator Gore, for reminding me about my performance in the 1988 vice presidential debate. This is 1992, Bill Clinton is running against President George Bush. There are 2 things that I'm going to stress during this debate: one, Bill Clinton's economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse -- he will raise your taxes, he will increase spending, he will make government bigger, jobs will be lost; second, Bill Clinton does not have the strength nor the character to be president of the US. (APPLAUSE) Let us look at the agendas. President Bush wants to hold the line on taxes, Bill Clinton wants to raise taxes. President Bush is for a balanced budget amendment, Bill Clinton is opposed to it. We want to reform the legal system because it's too costly, Bill Clinton wants the status quo. We want to reform the health care system, Bill Clinton wants to ration health care. Bill Clinton wants to empower government, we want to empower people. In St. Louis, Missouri, in June of this year, Bill Clinton said this: ""America is the mockery of the world."" He is wrong. At some time during these next 4 years there is going to be a crisis -- there will be an international crisis. I can't tell you where it's going to be, I can't even tell you the circumstances -- but it will happen.

<claim>Well, thank you, Senator Gore, for reminding me about my performance in the 1988 vice presidential debate.</claim>
<claim>This is 1992, Bill Clinton is running against President George Bush.</claim>
<claim>There are 2 things that I'm going to stress during this debate:</claim>
<premise><claim>one, Bill Clinton's economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse -- he will raise your taxes, he will increase spending, he will make government bigger, jobs will be lost</claim></premise>
<premise><claim>second, Bill Clinton does not have the strength nor the character to be president of the US</claim></premise>
<claim>(APPLAUSE) Let us look at the agendas.</claim>
<premise><claim>President Bush wants to hold the line on taxes, Bill Clinton wants to raise taxes.</claim></premise>
<premise><claim>President Bush is for a balanced budget amendment, Bill Clinton is opposed to it.</claim></premise>
<premise><claim>We want to reform the legal system because it's too costly, Bill Clinton wants the status quo.</claim></premise>
<premise><claim>We want to reform the health care system, Bill Clinton wants to ration health care.</claim></premise>
<premise><claim>Bill Clinton wants to empower government, we want to empower people.</claim></premise>
<claim>In St. Louis, Missouri, in June of this year, Bill Clinton said this: ""America is the mockery of the world."" He is wrong.</claim>
<claim>At some time during these next 4 years there is going to be a crisis -- there will be an international crisis.</claim>
<premise><claim>I can't tell you where it's going to be, I can't even tell you the circumstances -- but it will happen.</claim></premise>
<claim>We need a president who has the experience, who has been tested, who has the integrity and qualifications to handle the crisis.</claim>

"Yes. Let me say first, on an issue that the vice president said in his last answer before we got to this question, talking about tax policy, the country needs to know that under what they have put in place and want to put in place, a millionaire sitting by their swimming pool, collecting their statements to see how much money they're making, make their money from dividends, pays a lower tax rate than the men and women who are receiving paychecks for serving on the ground in Iraq. Now, they may think that's right. John Kerry and I do not. We don't just value wealth, which they do. We value work in this country. And it is a fundamental value difference between them and us. Now, as to this question, let me say first that I think the vice president and his wife love their daughter. I think they love her very much. And you can't have anything but respect for the fact that they're willing to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter, the fact that they embrace her. It's a wonderful thing.

"Not if I didn't have a better idea. But I've got a better idea. It's something I've worked on for 15 years. It's called the automated check or the instant check. It's being used in 17 states right now. States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states. You don't buy any gun. You don't get any gun. We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D. C. of people who should not have guns. We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns. I've been working on this for a long, long time. You walk in, you put your little card in there. If it says tilt, you don't get any gun. You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo. If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street. The administration says they support the instant check. They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway. In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite. This keeps up with technology. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. That is the bottom line. And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support. And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize. You talk about the Brady Bill. There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time. And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.

"Well, Gwen, the 90 percent figure is just dead wrong. When you include the Iraqi security forces that have suffered casualties, as well as the allies, they've taken almost 50 percent of the casualties in operations in Iraq, which leaves the U. S. with 50 percent, not 90 percent. With respect to the cost, it wasn't $200 billion. You probably weren't there to vote for that. But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq. The rest of it's for Afghanistan and the global war on terror. The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate. That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion we've got, but, you know, better than 40 percent. So your facts are just wrong, Senator. You also have a situation where you talk about credibility. It's awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared: Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time. You voted for the war, and then you voted against supporting the troops when they needed the equipment, the fuel, the spare parts and the ammunition and the body armor.

<claim> The 90 percent figure is just dead wrong.</claim>
<claim> When you include the Iraqi security forces that have suffered casualties, as well as the allies, they've taken almost 50 percent of the casualties in operations in Iraq, which leaves the U. S. with 50 percent, not 90 percent.</claim>
<claim> With respect to the cost, it wasn't $200 billion.</claim>
<claim> You probably weren't there to vote for that.</claim>
<claim> But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq.</claim>
<claim> The rest of it's for Afghanistan and the global war on terror.</claim>
<claim> The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate.</claim>
<claim> That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion we've got, but, you know, better than 40 percent.</claim>
<claim> So your facts are just wrong, Senator.</claim>
<claim> You also have a situation where you talk about credibility.</claim>
<claim> It's awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared: Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time.</claim>
<claim> You voted for the war, and then you voted against supporting the troops when they needed the equipment, the fuel, the spare parts and the ammunition and the body armor.</claim>

"Excellent question. And here is the simple difference. My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component. And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And I'm proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don't have as much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months' worth of oil and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future. I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it. But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply. To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production. We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.

Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America. The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska. When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day. Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.

"I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up. What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy. We've been very successful in both cases. We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago. This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history. We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error. He says he supports the President's position. He says that he voted for the resolution. Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands. But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa. He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made. He repeated it again in a television debate that we had. Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here. Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated. Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us. I support the President's position. I have always opposed drawing a line. I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want. And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up. It isn't enough for him to say ""I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution."" Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous. But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate. It's very simple for him to clear it up. He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense. If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim',

"Well, again, I'm running on the record. I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his. But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for. We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6. 1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people. I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to one-third of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them. I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that. All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see. I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years. So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.","['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

"Al Gore and I are committed to making America's public schools the best in the world. I disagree with what my opponent has said. A lot of progress has been made in recent years. Average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents, teachers and administrators all around America. There is more to be done. If you'll allow me, I want to go back to your last question. It leads to this question. I think both of us agree that leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, there's $1. 8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next ten years. As I said before we're being fiscally responsible about it. We're taking $300 billion off the top to put in reserve fund. The rest we'll use for middle class tax cuts and invest in programs like education. There's a big difference between these two tickets. Our opponents are going to spend $1. 6 trillion of the $1. 8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively. We're saving money to invest in education. You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money. Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose. To recruit 100,000 new teachers to reduce the size of classrooms. To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms. And we're not just going to stop at high school. We're going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct up to $10,000 a year in the cost of college tuition. Now, that is a tremendous life-saving change which will help people carry on their education and allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the hi-tech economy of today.","['B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']","

<claim>I think both of us agree that leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, there's $1.8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next ten years.</claim>
<premise>As I said before we're being fiscally responsible about it.</premise>
<premise>We're taking $300 billion off the top to put in reserve fund.</premise>
<premise>The rest we'll use for middle class tax cuts and invest in programs like education.</premise>
<claim>There's a big difference between these two tickets.</claim>
<premise>Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively.</premise>
<claim>We're saving money to invest in education.</claim>
<premise>You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money.</premise>
<claim>Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose.</claim>
<premise>To recruit 100,000 new teachers to reduce the size of classrooms.</premise>
<premise>To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms.</premise>
<claim>And we're not just going to stop at high school.</claim>
<premise>We're going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct"
"Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you. And thanks to Hofstra. And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you. It's good to see you again, Senator Obama. Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry. They're hurting, and they're angry. They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D. C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry. And they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat. But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes. Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes. The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse. I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up. Now, we have allocated $750 billion. Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.

"Well, let me say, first, he said in the same segment -- I don't remember precisely where it was connected with what you just read -- but he said, point blank, ""We will never give anyone a veto over the security of the United States of America."" What he's saying is we're going to go back to the proud tradition of the United States of America and presidents of the United States of America for the last 50 to 75 years. First, we're going to actually tell the American people the truth. We're going to tell them the truth about what's happening. We're not going to suggest to them that things are going well in Iraq or anyplace else when, in fact, they're not. We're going to make sure that the American people know the truth about why we are using force and what the explanation for it is. And it's not just the American people. We're also going to make sure that we tell the world the truth. Because the reality is, for America to lead, for America to do what it's done for 50 years before this president and vice president came into office, it is critical that we be credible. It is critical that they believe that when America takes action, they can trust what we're doing, what we say, what we say at the United Nations, what we say in direct conversations with leaders of the world -- of other countries. They need to know that the credibility of the United States is always good, because they will not follow us without that. And unfortunately, we're seeing the consequences of that right now. It's one of the reasons that we're having so much difficulty getting others involved in the effort in Iraq. You know, we've taken 90 percent of the coalition casualties. American taxpayers have borne 90 percent of the costs of the effort in Iraq. And we see the result of there not being a coalition: The first Gulf war cost America $5 billion. We're at $200 billion and counting. John Kerry will never give up control over the security of the United States of America to any other country.

"Thank you. The president said that he would unite this country, that he was a uniter, not a divider. Have you ever seen America more divided? Have you ever seen Washington more divided? The reality is it is not an accident. It's the direct result of the choices they've made and their efforts that have created division in America. We can do better than that in this country. Now I want to go back to the whole issue of health care, because we touched it, but I think the American people deserve to know what we would do different. I mean, 5 million people losing their health care -- everyone who's watching this knows health insurance premiums are through the roof. We need to talk about what we will do that they haven't done. First, we're going to make the same health care that's available to members of Congress available to all Americans. We're going to cover all kids. Not only that, we're going to bring down costs by pooling the catastrophic costs so we bring down premiums. And we're going to give tax breaks directly to families, save them up to $1,000 a year, and to businesses -- the vice president talked about that a few minutes ago -- so that they can provide health care to their employees. And we're also going to finally do something about the cost of prescription drugs. They've blocked allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada. We're going to allow it. They would not allow the government to use its negotiating power to get discounts for seniors. We're going to allow it.

"Well, I'm not for photo licensing. Let me say something about Columbine. Listen, we've got gun laws. He says we ought to have gun-free schools. Everybody believes that. I'm sure every state in the union has got them. You can't carry a gun into a school. And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school. But Columbine spoke to a larger issue. It's really a matter of culture. It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life. Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life? So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs. Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you. So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. And we can enforce law.

"Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening. And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond. But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement. Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan. That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible. We came from 100 different corners of the earth. We spoke a multitude of tongues. We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches. If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again. And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part. Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again. Today. we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight. And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat. That the best is over. That we must cut back. That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary. Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars. We've gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees. But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness. The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth. For 200 years, we've lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday. I still believe that. I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight. I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again. We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.

"I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. But they sued many people. I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things. I'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African-Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did.

"I believe experience counts, but it's not everything. Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something. I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people. My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine. That's because we believe in investing in education and in jobs. And we have to change in this country. You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We have got to have the courage to change. Experience is important, yes. I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month. I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year. I think the American people deserve better than they're getting. We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in. Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder. In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created. We need a new approach. The same old experience is not relevant. We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together. That is what works. And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience. Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.","['B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'O', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'B-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'I-Premise', 'O', 'B-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim', 'I-Claim']","
